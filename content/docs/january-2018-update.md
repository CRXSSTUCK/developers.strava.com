#### On Jan 17th there a couple of key changes to activity data that may affect your app: ####


* Update Webhook Events will exit beta and replace the current create-only webhook events system.
* Athlete-specific data will require authentication.


Our Swagger-based developer site is nearing the end of its beta period. There are still a few things to do, but we're getting close. We also recently switched over to Zendesk for support emails, hit us up at [developers@strava.com](mailto:developers@strava.com) and let us know what you think of the new developer site.

Don't forget to check out the [Strava App directory] (https://strava.com/apps) to see what other developers are building with the Strava API.
