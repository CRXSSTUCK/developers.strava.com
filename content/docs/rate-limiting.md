# Rate limiting

Strava API usage is limited on a per-application basis using both a 15-minute and daily request limit.
The default rate limit allows 600 requests every 15 minutes, with up to 30,000 requests per day.
This limit allows applications to make 40 requests per minute for about half the day.
As an application grows, its rate limit may need to be adjusted.
To request an adjustment, email api-rate-limits@strava.com.

An application's 15-minute limit is reset at natural 15-minute intervals corresponding to 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes after
the hour. The daily limit resets at midnight UTC.
Requests exceeding the limit will return `403 Forbidden` along with a JSON error message.
Note that requests violating the short term limit will still count toward the long term limit.

An application's limits and usage are reported on the [API application settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
page as well as returned with every API request as part of the HTTP Headers:
