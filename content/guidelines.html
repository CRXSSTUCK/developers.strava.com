Strava API Brand Guidelines
Welcome developers! We encourage the Strava community to take full advantage of the Strava Platform and API to develop new applications for the community. You do need to attribute your use of the Strava Platform while also avoiding any impression that your application is developed or sponsored by Strava. To use Strava API content, you need to comply with the Strava API Agreement and these simple branding guidelines.

Questions? Contact us at developers -at- strava.com.

2. Additional Rules Regarding Use of Strava Logos

Never use Strava logos in any manner that implies your application was developed or sponsored by Strava.
Strava logos can appear near, but must be completely separate and apart from (and should not appear more prominently than) the name/logo of your application.
Never use any part of a Strava logo as the icon for your application.
Never modify, alter or animate Strava logos

3. Mandatory Linking to Strava Data

You must link back to all original Strava data sources presented in your application using the following text format, “View on Strava”.

Text link should be legible.
Text link should be identifiable as a link by using one of the following type treatments: bold weight, underline, or orange color #FC4C02.

4. Use of the Strava Name and Trademark

You may make truthful, factual references to Strava in plain-text descriptions of your application’s features and benefits. You must not use the Strava name in your application name or make any other suggestion that your application is an official Strava app or is otherwise endorsed by Strava. The font size of the Strava name should not be larger than the surrounding font, and should not appear more prominently than the name of your application.

When referring to interoperability with Strava you must use one of the following:

“Powered by Strava”
“Compatible with Strava”
When referencing our company name use “Strava”. The Strava name and logos are all protected by applicable trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws. Strava reserves the right to cancel, modify or change these guidelines or the Strava API Agreement at any time at its sole discretion.
